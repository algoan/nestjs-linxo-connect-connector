# Algoan NestJS Oxlin connector

A simple connector using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) framework to connect your service to [Oxlin](https://oxlin.com/).

## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository for Algoan connectors.

## About Algoan and Oxlin

- [Algoan](https://www.algoan.com) helps companies to build the best open banking experience for credits. To see our products, please refer to our official website
- [Oxlin](https://developers.oxlin.io) is a french banking data aggregator for financial services.

## Goal and philosophy

A connector is a web software able to connect a provider to Algoan's API. It subscribes to REST Hooks which lets Algoan notifying the connector when a specific event happens.

The **`nestjs-oxlin-connector`** focuses on a user bank accounts and transactions. The main goal of this connector is to be able to retrieve a user bank data when Algoan wishes to.

## Listened subscriptions

This section describes the process required for each subscription for an aggregator connector.

### Aggregator Link Required

The Oxlin user needs to be redirected to an external page.

* The client should have this configuration data in the service account:
```
  {
    "clientId": string;
    "clientSecret": string;
  }
```

* And the event should contains the customerId:
```
  {
    customerId: string;
  }
```

Refers to the [`aggregator_link_required`](https://developers.algoan.com/public/docs/algoan_documentation/resthooks_and_events/event_list.html#aggregator_link_required) event.

### Bank Details Required

When the user has finished the aggregation process, the connector has to retrieve user's banks accounts and transactions.

* The event should contains those informations:
```
  {
    customerId: string;
    analysisId: string; // The ananlysis id to update with account and transaction data
  }
```

Refers to the [`bank_details_required`](https://developers.algoan.com/public/docs/algoan_documentation/resthooks_and_events/event_list.html#bank_details_required) event.

## Application Structure

- `config/`: stores all configurations for the application. It uses [node-config-ts](https://github.com/tusharmath/node-config-ts) to generate a type definition of the `default.json` file.
- `src/config/`: Simple NestJs module to inject configuration in services
- `src/algoan/`: Algoan module getting your service accounts. It uses the [@algoan/rest](https://github.com/algoan/rest-nodejs) library.
- `src/oxlin/`: Oxlin module to manage Oxlin API.
- `src/hooks/`: Entry point for your [RestHook](https://developers.algoan.com/public/docs/algoan_documentation/resthooks_and_events/resthooks.html) called by Algoan. It handles [events](https://developers.algoan.com/public/docs/algoan_documentation/resthooks_and_events/event_list.html) you've subscribed to.
- `test/`: contains e2e tests.

## Contributing

We would love to have your contribution, thank you for that! ðŸŽ‰

If you want to add missing APIs, or correct an issue, you will have to follow this list of instructions.

### Instructions

- Set up your local environment by forking the repository.
- When you are about to commit, [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) is running to check if your commit message respects [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- Write tests, there is a high coverage on the repository. Simply run `npm run test:cov` to generate a `coverage/` directory.
- Respect [coding style](#code-style). Run `npm run lint` to check if there are errors.
- Open a Pull Request where you describe the feature/issue you are about to publish.

### Code Style

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to analyze the TypeScript code. Commit are linted too thanks to [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) and the [conventional commit format](https://conventionalcommits.org/).

## Usage

How to use locally the connector

### Requirements

This connector is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) application. Before reading further, you need to [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/algoan/nestjs-oxlin-connector.git --depth=1
```

Install all dependencies running:

```bash
$ npm install
```

### How to test locally

To test locally the Oxlin Link process, a simple `index.html` file is rendered. To use it:

Before testing
- The client config: `locale`, `market`, `pricing` should be updated in `service-accounts.config` in  `./json-server/db.json'.
- You can enable http log `config/default.json` with `enableHttpRequestLog`, `enableHttpResponseLog`, `enableHttpErrorLog`

Run Test
- Run `npm run start:dev`. It will render an index.html file. Algoan APIs are exposed and mocked by a [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
- Go to your favorite browser and navigate to http://localhost:4000. It should display a web page:

![index_page](public/index-page.png)

- With the two provided buttons, you are able to test the two available Oxlin processes:
  - Redirect: Click on the button "Redirect to Oxlin Link". It will call a `GET /redirect` API which simulates a webhook call to your connector and tries to fetch a redirect URL. At the end of the Oxlin Link process, a `GET /callback?code=...` will be called. It will simulated the `bank_reader_details` webhook event to the connector.
  - Embedded: Click on the button "Open embedded Oxlin Link". It will call a `GET /iframe` API which simulates a webhook call to your connector, tries to fetch an iframe URL and display an iframe with this URL. At the end of the Oxlin Link process, a `GET /callback?code=...` will be called. It will simulated the `bank_reader_details` webhook event to the connector. Moreover, the iframe is remove from the interface.

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

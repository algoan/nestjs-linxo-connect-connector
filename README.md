# Algoan NestJS Linxo Connect connector

A simple connector using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) framework to connect your service to [Linxo Connect](https://linxoconnect.com/).

## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository for Algoan connectors.

## About Algoan and Linxo Connect

- [Algoan](https://www.algoan.com) helps companies to build the best open banking experience for credits. To see our products, please refer to our official website
- [Linxo Connect](https://developers.oxlin.io) is a french banking data aggregator for financial services.

## Goal and philosophy

A connector is a web software able to connect a provider to Algoan's API. It subscribes to REST Hooks which lets Algoan notifying the connector when a specific event happens.

The **`nestjs-linxo-connect-connector`** focuses on a user bank accounts and transactions. The main goal of this connector is to be able to retrieve a user bank data when Algoan wishes to.

## Listened subscriptions

This section describes the process required for each subscription for an aggregator connector.

### Aggregator Link Required

When the user is about to connect their bank accounts, the connector is triggered in order to supply the [Linxo Connect widget](https://developers.oxlin.io/docs/accounts-api-quickstart).

> ðŸ’¡ For now, we only support the Linxo Connect widget as [an iframe](https://developers.oxlin.io/docs/accounts-api-howto-iframe). If you want to redirect the end-user instead of embedding Linxo, please contact [us](mailto://support@algoan.com)

* The client should have this configuration data in the service account:
  
```typescript
  {
    "clientId": string;
    "clientSecret": string;
    "connectionUrl": string;
  }
```

* And the event should contains the customerId:

```typescript
  {
    customerId: string;
  }
```

The diagram below describes interactions:


```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant EU as End user
    participant Algoan
    participant LCC as Linxo Connect Connector
    participant LC as Linxo Connect
    EU ->> Algoan: Begins bank connection
    Algoan ->> LCC: trigger aggregator_link_required event
    LCC ->> Algoan: GET /v2/customers/{id}
    LCC ->> LC: Client authentication
    LCC ->> LC: Get or create a user
    LCC ->> LC: User authentication
    LCC ->> LC: Create a widget session
    LCC ->> Algoan: Send the widget URL
    Algoan ->> EU: Display Linxo Connect widget
```


### Bank Details Required

When the user has finished the aggregation process, the connector has to retrieve user's banks accounts and transactions.

* The event should contains those information:

```ts
  {
    customerId: string;
    analysisId: string; // The analysis id to update with account and transaction data
  }
```

The diagram below describes interactions:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant EU as End user
    participant Algoan
    participant LCC as Linxo Connect Connector
    participant LC as Linxo Connect
    EU ->> Algoan: End of the bank connection
    Algoan ->> LCC: trigger bank_details_required event
    LCC ->> Algoan: GET /v2/customers/{id}
    LCC ->> LC: Authenticate the user
    LCC ->> LC: Get connections
    LCC ->> LC: Get accounts
    LCC ->> LC: Get transactions
    LCC ->> Algoan: PATCH /v2/customers/{id}/analyses/{analysisId}            
```

Refers to the [`bank_details_required`](https://developers.algoan.com/public/docs/algoan_documentation/resthooks_and_events/event_list.html#bank_details_required) event.

## Application Structure

- `config/`: stores all configurations for the application. It uses [node-config-ts](https://github.com/tusharmath/node-config-ts) to generate a type definition of the `default.json` file.
- `src/config/`: Simple NestJs module to inject configuration in services
- `src/algoan/`: Algoan module getting your service accounts. It uses the [@algoan/rest](https://github.com/algoan/rest-nodejs) library.
- `src/linxo-connect/`: Linxo Connect module to manage Linxo Connect API.
- `src/hooks/`: Entry point for your [RestHook](https://developers.algoan.com/public/docs/algoan_documentation/resthooks_and_events/resthooks.html) called by Algoan. It handles [events](https://developers.algoan.com/public/docs/algoan_documentation/resthooks_and_events/event_list.html) you've subscribed to.
- `test/`: contains e2e tests.

## Contributing

We would love to have your contribution, thank you for that! ðŸŽ‰

If you want to add missing APIs, or correct an issue, you will have to follow this list of instructions.

### Instructions

- Set up your local environment by forking the repository.
- When you are about to commit, [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) is running to check if your commit message respects [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- Write tests, there is a high coverage on the repository. Simply run `npm run test:cov` to generate a `coverage/` directory.
- Respect [coding style](#code-style). Run `npm run lint` to check if there are errors.
- Open a Pull Request where you describe the feature/issue you are about to publish.

### Code Style

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to analyze the TypeScript code. Commit are linted too thanks to [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) and the [conventional commit format](https://conventionalcommits.org/).

## Usage

How to use locally the connector

### Requirements

This connector is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) application. Before reading further, you need to [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/algoan/nestjs-linxo-connect-connector.git
```

Install all dependencies running:

```bash
$ npm install
```

### How to test locally

To test locally the Linxo Connect Link process, a simple `index.html` file is rendered. To use it:

Before testing:

- The client config should be updated in `service-accounts.config` in  `./json-server/db.json'.
- You can enable http log `config/default.json` with `enableHttpRequestLog`, `enableHttpResponseLog`, `enableHttpErrorLog`

Run Test:

- Run `npm run start:dev`. It will render an index.html file. Algoan APIs are exposed and mocked by a [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
- Go to your favorite browser and navigate to http://localhost:4000. It should display a web page:

![index_page](public/index-page.png)

- With the two provided buttons, you are able to test the two available Linxo Connect processes:
  - Embedded: Click on the button "Open embedded Linxo Connect Link". It will call a `GET /iframe` API which simulates a webhook call to your connector, tries to fetch an iframe URL and display an iframe with this URL. At the end of the Linxo Connect Link process, a `GET /callback?code=...` will be called. It will simulated the `bank_reader_details` webhook event to the connector. Moreover, the iframe is remove from the interface.

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
